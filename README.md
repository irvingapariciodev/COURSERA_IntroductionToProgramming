# ﻿🚀 Async Programming & C# Practice

Hands-on C# console exercises focused on asynchronous programming, data handling, and basic system design.
Each menu option represents a small, isolated scenario you can run, modify, and extend.

# 🧭 What’s Inside

This project uses a menu-driven console application to demonstrate real-world async patterns and logic.

# 📋 Menu Overview

1️ -Simulate a single asynchronous method using async / await

2️ - Run multiple asynchronous methods concurrently

3️ - Display a simulated product list asynchronously

4️ - Load products and reviews using async operations

5️ - Simulate delayed responses (network-like behavior)

6️ - Validate user age input (generated with Copilot)

7️ - Sort data and calculate averages (generated with Copilot)

8️ - Library Management System – add, remove, show, search books

9️ - Sum numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

10 - Exit the application

# 🎯 Learning Goals

•	Learn how to use async and await in real C# scenarios

•	Understand how to run and coordinate multiple asynchronous tasks

•	Practice structuring a clean, menu-driven console application

•	Work with collections (lists, sorting, averages, searches)

•	Implement basic user input validation and control flow

•	Compare human-written code with AI-generated code (GitHub Copilot)

•	Build confidence in designing small, self-contained features
