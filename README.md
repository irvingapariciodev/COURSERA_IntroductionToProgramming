Async Programming & C# Practice Menu

This repository contains a collection of C# console-based exercises focused on asynchronous programming, data handling, and basic system design. Each menu option represents a small, self-contained scenario designed for learning and practice.

📋 Menu Options

Single Asynchronous Method
Simulates a single asynchronous operation using async and await.

Multiple Asynchronous Methods
Demonstrates running and coordinating multiple asynchronous methods.

Asynchronous Product List
Displays a simulated product list retrieved asynchronously.

Asynchronous Products and Reviews
Shows a simulated product list along with related reviews using asynchronous calls.

Asynchronous Delay Simulation
Simulates delayed responses to mimic real-world async operations.

User Age Validation (Copilot Generated)
Requests user age and validates whether it falls within a defined range.

Sorting and Average Calculation (Copilot Generated)
Sorts a simulated list, then calculates and displays the average value.

Library Management System – Version 1
Allows users to add, remove, show, and search books.

Library Management System – Version 2
Enhanced or alternative implementation of the library management system.

Exit
Closes the application.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice:

Asynchronous programming with async / await

Console application structure

Basic data manipulation

Incremental system design in C#
